# ATM Machine Exercise
This application simulates automatic withdrawals and deposits to an account balance. The applications will not allow for the operator to withdraw more money than is in the account. 

Select deposit or cash back from the drop down menu, and submit your request. 

## How to Run?
Download the files to a local folder and run using http-server.

## Roadmap of Future Impovements
I would like to add a more interactive error message when an operator tries to withdraw more money than is in the account. 
Adding a list of transactions over the last month, with an option to toggle to the last year, or even years would be a great feature. Adding the withdrawal/deposit amount, the new account balance, the date/time of the transaction, and the location of the transaction can all be saved and adjusted to the DOM using useState in React.
